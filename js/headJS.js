    details: `<p>I initiated this project in 2016 with absolutely no knowledge of coding.</p>
    <p>I quickly self-taught HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap, PHP, SQL and
    finished the Project as per schedule working 8 months over a span of 1 year.</p>
    <p>I designed, developed the code and content Single-handedly.</p>
    <p>I designed and developed a module which helped give student key performance metrics at
    macro and micro Language skills level to focus on in dynamic graphs. The
    students could choose target score to generate PTE skills they need to
    work on to meet their goals.</p>
    <p>At the time and may be even today my PTE mock tests most closely simulated
    the actual PTE test.</p>
    <p>The SERP focused design and content development helped the site be No. 1
    for many important keywords in key markets within a year.</p>`

    <p>"Great, you updated the social media links! You updated the Home navigation
    link to point to index.html instead of #. You correctly linked to and built a
    2nd page. You then went above and beyond creating an awesome 3rd page!"</p>
    <p>"Your profile image is under 400kb and your background image is under the 1MB
    requirement! Sweet, you updated the profile images alt attribute text, and left
    the "profile-image" class in place! You also added new styles/effects to the
    profile image and multiple new images throughout the project!"</p>
    <p>"Great job changing the placeholder text and then going a step beyond and
    adding in some additional text to your project. Your profile project is looking
    great! Plus you've changed the tag names to make your HTML more semantic. Very
    top notch work!"</p>
    <p>"Great job! Congratulations on successfully completing your first
    project. You've done a great job here showcasing your newly acquired skills and
    following all of the instructions to get your project across the finish line.
